CIS 415 project1 report

My code compiles with provided MakeFile and part1~4 are working 

Part1-it compiles it and work correctly
Part2-it compiles it and work correctly
Part3-it compiles it and work correctly (Got idea of setitimer from stack overflow
Source provided in part3.c comments) And also, got lots of information such as 
Time Quantum and concepts of Round Robin from text book and lab)
When I do GDB with Part3 or above version, if I incorrectly quit the GDB then
in top, the process is still running.

Part4-it compiles it and report proc (Got information of /proc/<pid>/stat,cmdline,io from
      man proc(5))
Part5 - I tried to implement dynamic scheduling, but I could not think any idea to change.

What I did,
Since IO bound has shorter time than CPU bound process, I just compare the usertime, and if one process have less time, then I swap it. But it doesn't seem to work.
If you see that it is not working correctly, please ignore it.

I tried to make my onalarm() function work as circular scheduler, but seems it runs 
little slow. 

Also, I checked with ./valtest 1, 2, 3, 4 and no memory leaks in child/parent processes
I checked with ./badtest and my all my programs exit correctly with error message
I checked iwth ./goodtest and it works correctly.

Not sure what to do with cpubound.c and iobound.c

I'm little concern that my onalarm() is working correctly. I wish I have a chance to see
sample output of project1-part3 and part4.

UPDATE> I'm not sure why sample output of part3 has proc information on Piazza post.
        I could not see any instruction of it, so I did not added to part3.
